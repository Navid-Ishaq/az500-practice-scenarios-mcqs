### 1. **Question Title**  
Simplifying Role Assignments with Microsoft Entra Groups

---

### 2. **New MCQ Scenario Statement**  
Sofia is a cloud administrator at **CloudNova Systems**, where multiple development teams are working on different Azure-based products. Each product has its own resource group in a shared subscription. 

To manage access, Sofia currently assigns roles directly to individual team members at the resource group level. However, as team members frequently join and leave, it‚Äôs becoming time-consuming to keep up.

She decides to use **Microsoft Entra ID** to streamline access control. For each product team, she creates a security group in Entra ID, adds the appropriate users, and then assigns roles to these groups at the resource group level.

Will this new method help her manage permissions more efficiently?

(a) No, because roles should only be assigned at the subscription level  
(b) Yes, group-based role assignments simplify access management  
(c) No, because Microsoft Entra ID groups can‚Äôt be used with Azure RBAC  
(d) Yes, but only if the users are assigned roles individually within the groups

### ‚úÖ 4. **Correct Answer**  
**Correct Answer:** (B)

---

### üí° 5. **Explanation**  
**Why (B) is correct:**  
Yes ‚Äî assigning roles to **Microsoft Entra groups** at the resource group level is a best practice in Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It simplifies permission management because you only need to update the group membership instead of reassigning roles every time someone joins or leaves a team. This approach is scalable, secure, and efficient.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**  

- **(A)**: Assigning roles only at the **subscription level** isn‚Äôt appropriate for granular control like managing access per application or per resource group. It‚Äôs too broad and can lead to over-permissioning.

- **(C)**: Actually, Microsoft Entra ID groups **can** be used with Azure RBAC. This is a common misconception. Role assignments can be made to users, groups, service principals, or managed identities.

- **(D)**: You don‚Äôt need to assign roles to **individual users within groups** ‚Äî that defeats the purpose of using groups. The role is applied to the **group as a whole**, and members inherit the access automatically.
