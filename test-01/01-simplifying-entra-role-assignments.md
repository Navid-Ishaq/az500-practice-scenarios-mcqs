### 1. **Question Title**  
Efficient Permission Management with Microsoft Entra Groups

---

### 2. **New MCQ Scenario Statement**  
Sofia is a cloud administrator at **NovaSky Innovations**, a company that develops several internal Azure-hosted tools. Each tool has its own resource group within the companyâ€™s Azure subscription, which is tied to a tenant synchronized with their on-prem AD using Microsoft Entra Connect.

To streamline access management, Sofia wants to assign permissions to multiple developers who frequently work across different tools. Sheâ€™s considering a strategy that minimizes repetitive role assignments while keeping access control clean and centralized.

She decides to create a separate Microsoft Entra group for each tool and assign the necessary role to that group at the corresponding resource group level. Developers are then added to the appropriate Entra groups based on their project involvement.

Is this an effective way to manage access?

### 3. **Answer Choices**  
(a) No, because roles should be assigned directly to individual users for more granular control  
(b) Yes, because assigning roles to Entra groups simplifies permission management and ensures scalability  
(c) No, because roles must always be applied at the subscription level for consistency  
(d) Yes, but only if Azure Blueprints are used to apply the roles across all resource groups

### âœ… 4. **Correct Answer:** (B)

---

### ðŸ’¡ 5. **Explanation**  
**Why (B) is correct:**  
Assigning roles to **Microsoft Entra groups** at the **resource group level** is a recommended and scalable practice. It reduces the need for individually managing permissions for each user, making it much easier to onboard, offboard, or reassign developers across projects. Sofiaâ€™s approach supports both clarity and efficiency in access control â€” especially in a multi-app, multi-team environment.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**  
- **(A)** sounds like it promotes control, but assigning roles directly to users becomes messy and error-prone as the number of users grows. It lacks scalability and is hard to audit.  
- **(C)** is incorrect because not all access needs to be granted at the subscription level. In fact, assigning roles at more granular scopes (like resource groups) helps ensure least-privilege access.  
- **(D)** misuses Azure Blueprints. Blueprints are great for standardizing deployments, policies, and role assignments across environments, but they are not *required* for the role-based model Sofia is using.
