### **Question Title**  
Avoiding Over-Permissioning with Proper Scope in Azure RBAC

---

### **MCQ Scenario**  
Ayesha is a cloud engineer at **SkyBridgeTech**, where each development team works on a different application hosted in Azure. These applications are isolated in separate **resource groups**, all under a shared **subscription**. The organization uses **Microsoft Entra Connect** to sync with on-premises Active Directory (AD DS), and team members often work across multiple apps.

Initially, Ayesha assigned roles at the **resource group level** for fine-grained access. However, to simplify management, she decides to remove those assignments and instead give each user the same role at the **subscription level** ‚Äî thinking it would be more efficient.

She now wants to verify whether this change still supports the principle of least privilege while keeping access manageable.

Does Ayesha‚Äôs revised approach meet the goal?

---

### **Options**  
(a) Yes, because assigning roles at the subscription level makes it easier to manage large groups of users  
(b) No, because assigning roles at the subscription level gives unnecessary access to unrelated resource groups  
(c) Yes, because role inheritance ensures correct access flows down to the resource groups  
(d) No, because Entra ID doesn't support subscription-level RBAC  

---

### ‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** (B)

---

### üí° **Explanation**  
**Why (B) is correct:**  
By assigning roles at the **subscription level**, Ayesha ends up granting access to **all resource groups** under that subscription. This goes against the **principle of least privilege**, which aims to give users only the permissions they absolutely need. In this case, users may gain access to apps they aren‚Äôt responsible for ‚Äî which introduces both security and governance risks.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**  
- **(A)** is tempting from a management point of view, but it‚Äôs risky. Easier does not mean safer ‚Äî it overexposes users to resources they shouldn‚Äôt access.  
- **(C)** is technically true that permissions flow down, but that‚Äôs the *problem* here ‚Äî not a benefit. It grants too much access.  
- **(D)** is simply incorrect ‚Äî Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD) absolutely supports RBAC at the subscription level.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Services Referenced in This Scenario**

---

### 1. **Microsoft Entra Connect**

Microsoft Entra Connect bridges your on-premises Active Directory (AD DS) with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
It enables hybrid identity synchronization, allowing centralized user and group management across environments.
In this scenario, it's used to sync on-prem users and groups into the Azure environment.

---

### 2. **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**

AD DS is the traditional on-premises identity solution used by many organizations for user and group management.
It supports security groups that can be synced to Microsoft Entra ID via Entra Connect.
Though not the primary focus here, it's the foundation of Ayesha‚Äôs organization‚Äôs identity model.

---

### 3. **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)**

Microsoft Entra ID is Azure‚Äôs cloud-based identity platform, used for authentication and access control.
It enables features like group-based access, single sign-on, conditional access, and directory syncing.
RBAC roles can be assigned to synced users and groups from here.

---

### 4. **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

RBAC allows fine-grained access management of Azure resources through built-in and custom roles.
Permissions can be assigned at different scopes ‚Äî management group, subscription, resource group, or resource level.
This scenario highlights the risks of assigning roles too broadly at the **subscription** level.

---

### 5. **Azure Subscription**

A subscription is a billing and resource management boundary in Azure.
It contains one or more resource groups, and you can apply RBAC roles at this level.
However, broad assignments here may over-permission users ‚Äî as Ayesha discovered.

---

### 6. **Azure Resource Groups**

Resource groups are containers for managing and organizing related Azure resources.
They support scoped RBAC assignments, making them ideal for applying least-privilege access.
Ayesha originally used this level to assign access, aligning well with security best practices.

      Access to:
      - App A - RG
      - App B - RG
      - App C - RG
      - Any future RGs (by default)
```


### üìù Key Takeaway:

* ‚úÖ Assigning roles at the **resource group level** enforces **least-privilege access**.
* ‚ùå Assigning roles at the **subscription level** **over-grants access**, even to apps the user may not work on.
* üìå Role inheritance is powerful ‚Äî but must be used **deliberately**, not for convenience alone.
