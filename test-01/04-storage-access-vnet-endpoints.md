### **Question Title**  
Securing Storage Access Without Exposing Public Endpoints

---

### **MCQ Scenario**  
Jordan works at **NovaByte Systems**, where he's helping set up a secure Azure environment for a new set of workloads. His team is deploying **virtual machines** in a **virtual network**, and these VMs need to read and write data to an **Azure Storage account**.

The company has three goals:
- Keep traffic **within Azureâ€™s private backbone network**  
- **Prevent exposure** to the public internet  
- **Reduce operational complexity**

Jordan enables a **Virtual Network service endpoint** on the storage account, thinking this will ensure the traffic stays private and secure without extra configuration.

Did Jordanâ€™s solution fully meet the companyâ€™s security and design goals?

### **Options**  
(a) No, because service endpoints do not block public access to the storage account by default  
(b) Yes, because service endpoints route traffic over the Azure backbone and automatically block public access  
(c) No, because VMs can only connect using a private endpoint in this scenario  
(d) Yes, because service endpoints are the most secure way to connect to any Azure service

### âœ… **Correct Answer**  
**Correct Answer:** (A)

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Explanation**  
**Why (A) is correct:**  
**Service endpoints** allow traffic from a virtual network to be routed over the **Azure backbone network**, which is great. However, **they do not automatically block public access** to the Azure resource. Unless **network rules or firewall settings** are updated to deny traffic from public IPs, the storage account will still be publicly accessible â€” violating the companyâ€™s security goals.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**  
- **(B)** is incorrect because it **assumes** that service endpoints disable public access by default â€” they donâ€™t.  
- **(C)** is partially misleading â€” while **private endpoints** offer stronger isolation, **they are not required** for connectivity. But in this case, the service endpoint alone doesnâ€™t meet all goals.  
- **(D)** overstates the capability of service endpoints. Theyâ€™re useful, but **private endpoints** are typically preferred for high-security needs.
