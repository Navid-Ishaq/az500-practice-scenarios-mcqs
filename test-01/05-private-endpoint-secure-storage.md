### **Question Title**  
Securing Azure Storage with Private Endpoints

---

### **MCQ Scenario**  
Sofia is helping the infrastructure team at **BlueGrid Labs** set up a secure Azure environment for their internal applications. The team has deployed a set of **virtual machines in a virtual network**, and these VMs must access an **Azure Storage account** that holds sensitive data.

The organization has three key goals:  
- Ensure all traffic flows **through Azure's private backbone**  
- Prevent any access **from the public internet**  
- Keep the setup **low-maintenance and secure by design**

Sofia configures a **private endpoint** for the storage account and confirms DNS resolution is working inside the virtual network.

Does her solution meet all three objectives?

---

### **Options**  
(a) No, because private endpoints require manual approval for each VM  
(b) Yes, because private endpoints enforce private IP access and block public connectivity  
(c) No, because traffic still flows through the public internet with a private endpoint  
(d) Yes, but only if a service endpoint is also enabled  

---

### ✅ **Correct Answer**  
**Correct Answer:** (B)

---

### 💡 **Explanation**  
**Why (B) is correct:**  
Private endpoints assign a **private IP address** from the virtual network to the Azure Storage resource. This means traffic from the VM to the storage account flows **entirely over the Azure backbone**, and **public access to the storage account is blocked**. It’s a clean, secure setup that requires little ongoing management, making it perfect for Sofia’s scenario.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**  
- **(A)** is incorrect — there’s no manual approval process for each VM. Any resource within the VNet that can resolve the private DNS can access the storage account via the private endpoint.  
- **(C)** is a common misconception — traffic *never* goes through the public internet when a private endpoint is properly configured.  
- **(D)** is misleading — you do **not** need a service endpoint when using a private endpoint. They’re different solutions for similar needs, but **not required together**.
