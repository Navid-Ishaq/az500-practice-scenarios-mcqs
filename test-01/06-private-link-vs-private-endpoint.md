### **Question Title**  
Understanding When to Use Azure Private Link Services

---

### **MCQ Scenario**  
Taylor is part of the cloud security team at **SkyBridgeTech**, where a new Azure environment is being set up to host sensitive internal apps. One of the key goals is to ensure that **virtual machines** deployed inside a **virtual network** can connect securely to an **Azure Storage account**, while meeting the following requirements:

- Traffic must stay **on Microsoft‚Äôs private Azure backbone**  
- Public access to the storage account must be **eliminated**  
- The solution should have **low administrative overhead**

Taylor decides to use **Azure Private Link services** for this purpose. She's confident it will provide the secure, private connectivity they need.

Did Taylor choose the correct solution?

---

### **Options**  
(a) No, because Private Link services are for exposing custom services, not consuming Microsoft services like Azure Storage  
(b) Yes, because Private Link services always enforce private IP communication  
(c) No, because Private Link services only work with VPN Gateway integration  
(d) Yes, because Private Link and private endpoints are the same  

---

### ‚úÖ **Correct Answer**  
**Correct Answer:** (A)

---

### üí° **Explanation**  
**Why (A) is correct:**  
**Azure Private Link services** are used when you want to **create a custom service in your own virtual network** and allow **other customers or VNets to access it privately**. They are not meant for *consuming Microsoft-managed services* like Storage, Key Vault, or SQL ‚Äî for that, you use a **Private Endpoint** instead.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**  
- **(B)** is incorrect because it wrongly assumes that Private Link services are always the right tool for private communication ‚Äî in this case, it's the wrong one.  
- **(C)** is a technical misunderstanding ‚Äî Private Link services don‚Äôt require or rely on VPN Gateway integration.  
- **(D)** is a common mix-up ‚Äî **Private Endpoint** is a *consumer* of Private Link; **Private Link service** is for *publishing* your own service privately. They are not interchangeable.

### üìù Legend:

* ‚úÖ **Use Private Endpoint** to securely connect to Microsoft-managed services like Storage, SQL, Key Vault, etc.
* ‚ùå **Private Link Service** is only for exposing your **own services** privately to other customers or VNets.
